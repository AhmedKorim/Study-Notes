# Accessibility

## 1. A11y Overview

- **Definition**: A11y means that site _**content**_ should be available to everyone and _**functionality**_ is operable to everyone.
- It affects every user of your website, having _disabilities_, or others with _no disabilities_ but can not access your website due to unresponsive design, colors, etc...


### a. Screen Readers

### b. WCAG , Web Aim, and POUR

- **[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
It is about making your site POUR.

- **POUR**: Percievable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
- **[Web Aim Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)**: a checklist for ensuring that the website meets WCAG guidelines.



## 2. FOCUS

- [Web Aim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.1.1)
- Implicity focusable elements (automatic tab order + built-in keyboard event handling) ex.:
  - input elements.
  - buttons.
- _No need_ to focus something if the user can NOT interact with it, or provide some sort of input from the user.
- [Focus Management](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management)- tab order is the same as DOM order even if the _visual_ order ( by CSS ) is changed.
- Changing the order _visually_ can cause confusion to users depend on keyboard navigation. [Web Aim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.2).


### a. tabindex attribute

- tabindex = "-1"
[] Not in tab order.
[] can be programmatically focused by focus()
[] For Off screen content (appears in response to user event) like modals.
```
<dialog id="modal" tabindex="-1"></dialog>
```

- tabindex = "0"
[] Insert natively Unfocusable element in tab order.
[] can also be programmatically focused by focus()
[] And then keyboard events get directed to it.
```
<div id="dropdown" tabindex="0"></div>
```

- tabindex > 0
[] In front of tab order.
[] If multiple elements the lowest value is the first in tab order.
[] **ANTI - PATTERN**
[] Confuse screen readers and also keyboard users.
[] Instead change elements DOM order.
