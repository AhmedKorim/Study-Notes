# Accessibility

## 1. A11y Overview

- **Definition**: A11y means that site _**content**_ should be available to everyone and _**functionality**_ is operable to everyone.
- It affects every user of your website, having _disabilities_, or others with _no disabilities_ but can not access your website due to unresponsive design, colors, etc...


### a. Screen Readers

### b. WCAG , Web Aim, and POUR

- **[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
It is about making your site POUR.

- **POUR**: Percievable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
- **[Web Aim Checklist](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)**: a checklist for ensuring that the website meets WCAG guidelines.



## 2. FOCUS

- [Web Aim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.1.1)
- Implicity focusable elements (automatic tab order + built-in keyboard event handling) ex.:
  - input elements.
  - buttons.
- _No need_ to focus something if the user can NOT interact with it, or provide some sort of input from the user.
- [Focus Management](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management)- tab order is the same as DOM order even if the _visual_ order ( by CSS ) is changed.
- Changing the order _visually_ can cause confusion to users depend on keyboard navigation. [Web Aim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.2).


### a. tabindex attribute

- tabindex = "-1"

[.] Not in tab order.

[.] can be programmatically focused by focus()

[.] For Off screen content (appears in response to user event) like modals.
```
<dialog id="modal" tabindex="-1"></dialog>
```

- tabindex = "0"

[.] Insert natively Unfocusable element in tab order.

[.] can also be programmatically focused by focus()

[.] And then keyboard events get directed to it.
```
<div id="dropdown" tabindex="0"></div>
```

- tabindex > 0

[.] In front of tab order.

[.] If multiple elements the lowest value is the first in tab order.

[.] **ANTI - PATTERN**

[.] Confuse screen readers and also keyboard users.

[.] Instead change elements DOM order.


#### :alien:  JS
To get tabindex value of an element:
`element.tabIndex;`


```
Don't add focus to any content user will Not interact with.
```

#### :exclamation: Exception:

### b. Skip links

- Allows screen reader users and keyboard, or switch devices users to directly navigate towards main content of the page bypassing navigation items and other things before main content.
- Visually hidden until it comes into focus.
```
<!--html code-->
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
<nav>
.
.
.
</nav>
<main id="main-content" tabindex="-1">
.
.
.
</main>
```
```
/*CSS code*/
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  top: -40px;
  left: 0;
  background: red;
  color: white;
  padding: 8px;
  z-index: 100;
  }
.skip-link:focus {
  top: 0;
  }
  ```

:alien: **[Alternate way to skip to main content.](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/#headings)**

### c. Managing Focus at the component level

 - Like in case of drop down menu, tree view component. The keyboard interaction after getting focused is what we are talking about.
 - [WAI-Aria guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/) provide guidance in selcting which keyboard interaction is appropriate for such action.
 

### d. Roving Focus

- To implement focus inside of a component.
- For example: Radio group:
  - first radio button: 1. tabindex="0" / 2. checked / 3. focus()
  - when moving to the next element => first element: 1. tabindex="-1" / 2. remove checked / 3. unfocus :: next element: 1. tabindex="0" / 2. checked / 3. focus()
  - If it is the last element `tab` move us to the first element.
  - If it is the first element `shift` + `tab` move us to the last element.
  
  - [Example](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/radio/radio-1/radio-1.html)
