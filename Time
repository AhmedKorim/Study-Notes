Look for the next year review on the professiona part and personal part.
Imagine the reiew was that it was an amazing year for both professional and personal parts.
Figure out what made it so amazing => write 3 to 5 things that did so fr every part.
Plan to work on these things through the next year => put them on your first periorities.
Break each of them into small doable parts.
Make a a schedule tht contains 3 divisions: professional, relatioships, and self.
Put the tasks into these divisions at every weekend (Thursday suggested).
