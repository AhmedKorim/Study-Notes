## **let and const:**
- **Variables declared with let and const eliminate this specific issue of hoisting because theyâ€™re scoped to the block, not to the function.**
- **Variables declared with var are either scoped globally or locally the function scope.**
- **Rules for using let and const:**
    - Variables declared with **_let_**: [ ] can be reassigned.
                                         [ ] can't be redeclared in the same scope. 
    - Variables declared with **_const_**: [ ] must be assigned an initial value.
                                           [ ] can't be reassigned.
                                           [ ] can't be declared in the same scope.
